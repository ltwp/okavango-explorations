    "# Sentinel-2 DSWE Monthly Generator\n",
    "This code employs Sentinel-2 remote sensing data (blue, green, red, NIR, SWIR1, and SWIR2) within the Dynamic Surface Water Extent (DSWE) algorithm to develop monthly water inundation extent maps for a given study area. The code first creates monthly composites from avaialable Sentinel-2 data, then applies the algorithm, exporting each product as an asset to Google Earth Engine.\n",
