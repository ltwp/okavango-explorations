    "This script uses the geemap package to export monthly Landsat-derived DSWE products (DSWE mask, QC mask, and RGB of composite) and monthly Sentinel-2 based DSWE products. The code is directed to a GEE asset folder, a study area boundary for clipping, and a local output folder. The code iterates through the assets and exports as .tifs, tiling when needed.\n",
